# GieldaPredict
Predicting stock market behaviour and share declines


## AWS
EMR:
          - prepaired bucket S3 in which I made catalogs for logs, outputs, program code and input (which is probably unnecessary, but I was trying to manage errors)
          - prepaired VPC and connected it to EMR cluster
          - prepaired and launched EC2
